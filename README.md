# Word-Guess-Game
When you open up my web page there is a mood music button. When you click that it begins the Addam's Family theme music. This will set the vibe for the game. The jumbotron in the middle has some text about the game. The javascript isn't working- but I have text on the actual page I just cannot get it to pull up on the webpage. I am sure it is a bunch of little things. I created an array of words. Then I set up a function for loop that would run through the word lengths to create "_" for the word the user was guessing. Then picking a word and displaying that word "_" on the screen. Then I wanted to add the user only gets so many tries so I did an if/else if/else statement. Lastly I added the audio which works perfectly fine when the button is pressed. Although I didn't do a stop, so if you click the button you HAVE to listen! Unless you reload.
